# Web-Chat
This document aims at defining a Web based application called as Web Chat that is basically used for chatting purpose with remote client or User(friend) on internet. It forms up a circle of friends or user with whom you want to chat. This application allows us to find out wether a person is online or offline by his status. To start chatting, users will have to register with the web site. He/she registers with a user-name, password and Email Address.
                    After login the user can chat with the available other users who have registered with the system. Here session of the user is maintained which act as a main part in securing user account with the system. By registering with the web site user’s password is encrypted and stored in the data base. This makes the users account more secured i.e. only user can access his account. Further a Forget Password option is given if the user forgets his password. In this a mail is sent to the registered email id that was given by the user during registration.
